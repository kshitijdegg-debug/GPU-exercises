The colab notebook contains codes for parallel CUDA kernels like - vector addition, matrix multiplication, vector sum computation, pointwise modular multiplication (used in Homomorphic Encryption). Montgomery modular multiplication can also be implemented.

There is use of global memory, shared memory, blocks, threads, barrier synchronization.
